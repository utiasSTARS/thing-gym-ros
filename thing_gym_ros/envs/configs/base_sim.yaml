# Base config file for all sim envs. Other envs will use these values unless they are specifically overwritten
# with their own config files.

# note: as a rule of thumb, these values should be as reusable as possible between envs, while values that
#       are expected to change between each env should be actual class parameters.

# resetting
reset_base_tool_tf: [-0.226, .849, 1.071, .008, .006, .632]  # 3 for trans, 3 for rot as explained in README
reset_joint_pos: [-1.38, -1.51, -1.88, -.38, 1.13, 2.89]     # 1 per joint, ensures consistent pose for above tf

control_freq: '10'            # in Hz -- true control freq will be slightly lower based on policy process time
poses_ref_frame: 'b'          # 'b' or 'w' for base or world
arm_max_trans_vel: .15        # m/s, also value used for resets

# Base config file for all envs. Other envs will use these values unless they are specifically overwritten
# with their own config files.

# note: as a rule of thumb, these values should be as reusable as possible between envs, while values that
#       are expected to change between each env should be actual class parameters.

# TODO
# 2. try multiview hard env (stack 1 or stack 2 or insert PLUS FT SENSORS)
# IF THINGS DONT WORK
# 1. ensure that depth values are what is expected
# POSSIBLE BUGS
#     - control gets very stuttery in stack env, could be that control loop is too slow OR that FT is causing
#       jumping inputs??
#     - after triggering a correction, robot slightly changes position
#     -
